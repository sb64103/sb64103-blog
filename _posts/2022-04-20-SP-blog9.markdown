<h1>What is Kubernetes?</h1>
{: .h1-text}

Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that lets you deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications. Kubernetes is an open-source platform/tool created by Google. It is written in GO-Lang. It is also known in its abbreviated form as k8s.

<h1> Why we need Kubernetes? </h1>
{: .h1-text}

Kubernetes can help us manage containers. The orchestration allows you to build application services that span multiple containers, schedule those containers across a cluster, scale those containers, and manage the health of those containers over time.
