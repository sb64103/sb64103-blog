<h1>What are the IP Tables?</h1>
{: .h1-text}

`iptables` is a program that can allow a system admin to configure the ip packet filter rules in a linux firewall.

There are 3 main tables but a total of 5 tables. Each table has it's own roles. 

Table Name          | Role                     |
:-------------:| ------------------------------|
`Filter`| Make a decision whether to allow a packet to continue to it's intended destination or deny it's request. |
`NAT`| Provide Network Address Translation rules, route the packets when direct access is not possible  |
`Mangle`| Modify IP headers of the packet |
`RAW`| Used for connection tracking, marking and view packets |
`Security`| SET SELinux tagging |

<h1>What are Chains?</h1>
{: .h1-text}

Chains are points in packets where you can apply the rules. 

1. `Pre-Routing`- Any incomming packet very soon after entering the network stack
1. `Input` - When packet enters the network stack
1. `Forward` - Packet routed through the system
1. `Output` - Packet orginated and going out
1. `Post Routing` - After routing decision and packet going on wire


**Note: Not every chain is available in each table.**

<h1>What are rules?</h1>
{: .h1-text}

User defined command to manipulate the network traffic. As each chain is called, the packet will be checked in order and the rule will be applied.

Matching component can include:

- Protocol
- IP Address
- Port Address
- Interfaces
- Headers

Target componenet can be terminating or non-terminating:

- Accept
- Drop
- Queue
- Return
- User-Defined

<h1>What are syntax?</h1>
{: .h1-text}

We can apply basic rules like blocking a website or removing that rule.
**Note: You might need to run sudo**

{% highlight html linenos %}
#basic syntax
iptables -t[table] -options[chain] [matching component] [action componenet]

#if we want to block a website (youtube)
iptables -A INPUT -s youtube.com -j DROP

#to remove the rule from iptables (since the first rule was applied, we note that it was 1)
iptables -D INPUT 1

#to check the rules in the main filter table
iptables -L -n -v

#we can also block all network request
iptables -P INPUT DROP

{% endhighlight %}
