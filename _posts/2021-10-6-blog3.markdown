<h1>Intro</h1>
{: .h1-text}
Virtualization is when we use any physical machines' hardware to run multiple virtual machines within it. Docker is a software for virtualization that helps IT infrastructure scale and support business demand. When applications needs to be deployed, docker is like a shipping container because it keeps everything intact.

There are many benefits to using Docker
<li>- Ability to Run Anywhere: run locally or in a cloud server</li>
<li>- Fast Deployment: we can use it deploy an applications within seconds</li>
<li>- Offers Automation: using dockerfile an image can be created instantly</li>
<li>- Flexibility: multiple images can be created to support different architecture</li>

<h1>Dockerfile</h1>
{: .h1-text}

One of the best features of docker is using a <code>Dockerfile</code> to create an image. This helps us save time when we want to start a machine with many services running or a particular directory to be created in order to do some task. Uisng a dockerfile, we are able to achieve full automation as the image can be created from any source or repository.

{% highlight html linenos %}

#gets the image from the docker repository
FROM ubuntu:18.04

#author -- does not affect code
MAINTAINER saikat barua <saikat.barua.994@my.csun.edu>

#instructions for the image to update libraries
RUN apt-get update

#instructions for the image to install a library 'wget'
RUN apt install -y wget

#instructions for the image to install a library 'curl'
RUN apt install -y curl

#instructions for the image to create a directory
RUN mkdir packages

{% endhighlight %}

Another great benefit of using a dockerfile is that you can run this from any github repository. This means that the image will get created after a git pull has been initiated

`docker build -t Dockerfile  <github repo>`
